# leave-management
This is a ASP.NET Core 3.1 Project that I made in ASP.NET 5.0
It was made with MVC and Repository pattern with a database connection with it's own usermanagement and rolemanagement system built over the existing management system that comes with ASP.NET

It also have alot of it's own logic and I really recommend doing this course on Udemy if you want to learn more about what I did in this project.
